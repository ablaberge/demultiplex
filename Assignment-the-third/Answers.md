Output:
```
        30783962 read-pairs had unknown index-pairs.
        707740 read-pairs had hopped index-pairs.
        331755033 read-pairs matched!
```

Because we had 707,740 index hopped pairs, we divide this by 2 to determine that 353,870 index hopping events took place. This is equivalent to a occurance rate of 0.2%. Unknown indexes occured roughly 8.5% of the time in total.
